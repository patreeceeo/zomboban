      <p>You're just a fox who lives among the ruins of an ancient civilization. Many of its artifacts mingle with the flora and fuana, including freely wandering <b>golem</b>. No one knows much about the civilization who left such a mess, but legend says they worshipped power&hellip;

      <p>Your brother has recently become fascinated by these artifacts and the legend surrounding them. Last time you saw him he was going on and on about a <b>dark crystal</b> that can be used to control the golem.</p>

      <p>That was a week ago&hellip;</p>
